<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I've chosen to remain anonymous for safety and privacy reasons.</p>

<p>Here are some details about me that I can share.</p>

<div className="about-me">
<ul>â€¢ I reached financial independence before getting into Cryptocurrency.</ul> <p>I did this by building an e-commerce brand for over a decade and then selling it. I've been into the FIRE movement early on (Financial independence, retire early). I've always lived a frugal life and invested in index funds.</p>

<ul>â€¢ I've been in Cryptocurrency since 2013. I lost all my Bitcoin in the Mt. Gox hack.</ul> <p> I entered again in the 2017 Bull Cycle. Built a 7 figure portfolio and saw it crash -90% with Crypto winter.</p>

<ul>â€¢ I entered Crypto again in late 2020.</ul><p> I built a large portfolio through early investments in BNB, PancakeSwap, Luna, and others.</p>

<ul></ul> <p>(And by taking profits aggressively)</p>

<ul></ul> <p>It's because of this that I'm interested in being on the edge of Crypto.</p>
